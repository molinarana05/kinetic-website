The most expensive thing in content marketing is not the video production, the design retainer, or the copywriter. It is the **cost of creating something once and using it once**. Every asset you produce that only lives in one format is a wasted investment.

Content repurposing — done at a systems level — is how you extract 30x more value from the same insight.

## What Content Repurposing Actually Means

Most people think repurposing means copying a blog post into LinkedIn and calling it done. That is syndication, not repurposing. True content repurposing is a **transformation** — taking the core insight from one format and rebuilding it natively for another channel, audience, and context.

A single 60-minute interview contains:
- 5-7 distinct ideas, each strong enough for a standalone post
- 3-4 direct quotes that work as thought leadership
- 1-2 contrarian perspectives that generate debate
- Multiple anecdotes that become stories
- Data points or frameworks that become carousels

The system that extracts all of this from one source session is what separates one-piece creators from multi-channel brand engines.

## The Moxie Content Repurposing System

### Step 1: The Extraction Interview

Every repurposing cycle starts with a source session — a structured 60-minute interview designed to surface:

- **Core thesis**: What is the central argument?
- **Battle stories**: What specific outcomes, failures, or observations support the thesis?
- **Contrarian take**: What does the speaker believe that most people do not?
- **Tactical breakdown**: What is the actionable process?

The interview technique is critical. Open-ended prompts produce vague answers. Structured prompts produce quotable, shareable content.

### Step 2: The Content Matrix

From the source session, map the content matrix — a grid of formats against ideas:

| Core Idea | LinkedIn Post | Newsletter Section | Blog Post | Short Video Script | Twitter Thread |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Idea 1 | ✓ | ✓ | Pillar | | ✓ |
| Idea 2 | ✓ | | | ✓ | |
| Idea 3 | ✓ | ✓ | Supporting | ✓ | |

Not every idea fits every format. Part of the system skill is knowing which format makes each idea shine.

### Step 3: Platform-Native Adaptation

Here is where most repurposing fails. Creators copy the same text across channels. Platform-native adaptation means:

**LinkedIn**: First-person voice, conversational, hook in line one. No hashtag spam. 150-1,500 words. Stories outperform advice.

**Newsletter**: Third-person analysis is allowed. The subscriber is opting in for depth. 400-800 words per section. Drive one CTA.

**Blog/SEO**: Long-form, keyword-informed, answer engine optimized. This is the evergreen asset. 800-2,500 words.

**Short Video**: Script the story in 60-90 seconds. Start mid-action. Deliver the payoff in the last 10 seconds.

### Step 4: The Publishing Cadence

Repurposed content needs to be staggered, not published simultaneously. If the LinkedIn post, blog post, and newsletter go live on the same day, users who follow across channels see the same idea three times in 24 hours. That feels like spam.

Recommended stagger:
- Day 1: LinkedIn post (highest immediacy)
- Day 4: Newsletter section (supporting context)
- Day 10: Blog post (longest shelf life)
- Day 21: Short video (top-of-funnel re-amplification)

## The 10x Content Formula

The formula for any repurposable piece of source content:

1. One 60-minute interview = one extraction document
2. One extraction document = 5-7 LinkedIn posts
3. One extraction document = 2-3 newsletter sections  
4. One extraction document = 1-2 blog posts
5. One extraction document = 1-2 video scripts

**Total distribution** from one source session: 11-15 pieces of content across 4 channels.

Do this monthly, optimise what works, and double down. By month six, you have 60-90 pieces of content in distribution, pulling pipeline 24/7.

## The Compounding Effect

Here is what most content advice ignores: **the value of content compounds**. A LinkedIn post from six months ago can suddenly go viral if the algorithm resurfaces it. A blog post published last year can start ranking for a new keyword. An old newsletter can be referenced by a new subscriber who just joined.

Content created once, with repurposing built in from the start, keeps working indefinitely. That is the real ROI of the system.
