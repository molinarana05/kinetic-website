A branding consultant is either the best investment you'll make in your business this year, or an expensive way to produce a PDF nobody reads.

The difference is entirely in what they actually do — and whether it matches what you actually need.

Let's cut through the noise.

## The Wide Spectrum of "Branding Consultant"

The job title "branding consultant" covers an enormous range of actual work. Before you engage anyone, you need to know which version you're buying.

### Type 1: The Visual Identity Designer

These consultants specialize in the look and feel of your brand — logos, color palettes, typography systems, brand guidelines documents.

**Good for:** Companies with zero visual identity or those actively rebranding after an event (acquisition, pivot, new product launch).

**Not good for:** Companies that already have a visual identity but lack market traction and inbound leads.

### Type 2: The Brand Strategist

This is the consultant who helps you answer the hard questions: What market position do you own? What does your brand stand for and against? What is your messaging hierarchy?

**Good for:** Companies with unclear market position or struggling to differentiate in a crowded category.

**Not good for:** Companies that need operational execution, not strategy. A strategy that never gets distributed is worthless.

### Type 3: The Brand + Content Operator

This is the rarest and often the most valuable type. They combine strategic clarity with operational execution — building the system that distributes your brand into the market consistently.

**Good for:** Founders who know their position but are too busy to consistently publish it. Companies where the founder's voice is the most powerful marketing asset.

**Not good for:** Large enterprises that need departmental brand governance at scale.

## What Great Branding Consultants Do (Regardless of Type)

Here's what separates excellent branding consultants from expensive ones:

### They Make You More Specific, Not More Generic

Bad branding consultants produce positioning that appeals to everyone — and therefore, nobody. Good ones push you toward specificity that feels uncomfortable until it starts working.

*"We help B2B technology companies improve marketing results"* is garbage positioning.

*"We install revenue-first founder content engines for B2B challenger brands with 15-100 person teams"* is a positioning that a specific, qualified buyer immediately recognizes as describing them.

If your branding consultant's first instinct is to broaden your audience rather than narrow it, find someone else.

### They Have Domain Expertise (Not Just Brand Expertise)

A branding consultant who has worked in your category — who understands your buyer's specific psychology, technical vocabulary, and decision-making process — is worth 10x a generalist brand consultant.

Ask them: *"What B2B companies in my space have you actually worked with? What specific outcomes did you deliver?"*

Vague, credential-laden answers are a red flag. Specific case studies are green lights.

### They Tie Deliverables to Revenue Outcomes

Every engagement should have a clear answer to: **How will this change what buyers do?**

- A visual identity rebrand should reduce time-to-close because prospects find the company more credible.
- A messaging strategy should improve outbound reply rates and inbound inquiry quality.
- A content system should increase branded search traffic and inbound leads over 90 days.

If your branding consultant can't connect their work to a downstream commercial outcome, they're in the wrong business.

## How Much Should You Pay a Branding Consultant?

*Before investing $10k+ in brand strategy, diagnose your current baseline. Use our free [Founder Brand Score](/tools/founder-brand-score) tool to see exactly where your brand is leaking revenue today.*

The range is enormous:

| Engagement Type | Typical Range |
|---|---|
| Logo + visual identity | $2,000 – $25,000 |
| Brand strategy sprint | $10,000 – $40,000 |
| Ongoing monthly retainer (content + brand ops) | $3,000 – $15,000/month |

The right number depends on the scope and the expected ROI. A $40k brand strategy engagement that helps you raise a Series A or land your three biggest enterprise accounts in the next year is a bargain. A $5k logo project that doesn't solve your positioning problem is expensive.

## The Branding Consultant Red Flags Checklist

Before signing anything, walk away if you see:

- ❌ No clear deliverables or success metrics in the proposal
- ❌ "We work with everyone" — no specific ICP focus
- ❌ Only showing B2C or enterprise brand case studies when you're early-stage B2B
- ❌ Promising to "create your brand voice" without spending meaningful time extracting your existing insights
- ❌ A 12-month retainer proposal before any diagnostic work is done
