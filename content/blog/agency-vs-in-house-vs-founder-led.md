You've built a great B2B software product. You have some early traction. Now you need to pour fuel on the fire and start generating predictable pipeline.

The very first decision you have to make is how to staff the growth engine. Do you hire an expensive external agency? Do you try to recruit a full-time in-house team? Or do you lean into founder-led marketing?

Below is a pragmantic breakdown of the pros, cons, and ROI of each approach.

## 1. The Traditional Digital Agency

For decades, the standard B2B playbook was to raise a seed round and immediately hand $10,000/month to an external marketing agency. 

### The Pros:
- **Immediate Capacity:** You quickly get access to designers, copywriters, and ad managers without having to recruit them individually.
- **Tool Access:** Agencies have expensive enterprise software licenses (Ahrefs, Hubspot, etc.) built into their cost.

### The Cons:
- **The "B-Team" Problem:** The senior partners pitch you, but the actual execution is often handed off to junior account managers who change every six months.
- **Lack of Industry Context:** A typical agency manages a dog food brand in the morning and your complex B2B SaaS product in the afternoon. They simply do not understand the deep nuances of your highly technical buyer.
- **Vanity Metrics:** Agencies often report on "impressions," "clicks," and "MQLs" (Marketing Qualified Leads) that never close, rather than actual closed-won revenue.

## 2. The In-House Hire

The alternative to the agency is hiring a full-time marketing manager or CMO.

### The Pros:
- **Deep Alignment:** An in-house hire lives and breathes your product. They attend the product meetings, talk to the sales team, and develop a deep understanding of the customer.
- **Control:** You have daily access to direct the strategy and pivot rapidly when needed.

### The Cons:
- **High Cost:** A senior marketing leader capable of actually driving strategy costs $150k+ base salary, plus equity and benefits. 
- **The Talent Gap:** If you can't afford a senior leader and hire a junior "marketing coordinator," they will likely lack the strategic chops to build the engine from scratch. They need management. You are a busy founder; you don't have time to manage them.
- **Ramp Time:** It takes months to recruit, hire, and onboard a new full-time employee before they start producing ROI.

## 3. The Founder-Led Growth Engine + Partner

A modern alternative that is rapidly gaining traction among high-growth startups is the "Founder-Led" model powered by a senior growth partner (like Moxie Digital).

In this model, the founder is the face, the thought leader, and the primary source of insight. The growth partner acts as the "operator" who extracts that insight and builds the underlying systems to distribute it.

### The Pros:
- **Unmatched Authority:** Content originating from the founder cuts through the noise and instantly builds trust with enterprise buyers in a way no agency copywriter ever could.
- **Cost Efficiency:** You get the strategic execution of a senior operator without paying a full-time executive salary or carrying agency overhead. 
- **Revenue Focus:** Because the system leverages organic authority (LinkedIn, SEO, Newsletters), CAC drops dramatically, and the focus remains strictly on pipeline generation, not vanity metrics.

### The Cons:
- **Requires Founder Buy-in:** This system only works if the founder is willing to commit 60-90 minutes a month to an "Extraction Session" to provide raw material. If you refuse to participate in your own brand, this won't work.

## The Verdict

If you are selling a highly commoditized, low-ACV product, a traditional agency running Google Ads might work.
